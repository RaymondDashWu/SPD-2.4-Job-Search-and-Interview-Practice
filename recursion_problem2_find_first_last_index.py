# Given a sorted array of strings, write a recursive function to find the index of the first and last occurrence of a target string. If the target string is not found in the array, report that.
# Example input:  instructors = [Adriana, Adriana, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, Alan, Braus, Braus, Braus, Braus, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dan, Dani, Dani, Jess, Meredith, Milad, Milad, Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell, Mitchell]
# Example execution:  find_indexes(instructors, 'Braus')  â‡’  (7, 10)

# PSEUDO BRAINSTORM 1 - Scratched. O(n) but there's a more efficient way since it comes pre-sorted
# initialize a ind_tracker that will be used to keep track of indexes
# initialize index array based on ind_tracker
# base case when there is something in ind_arr and next instructor is not target
# when the target instructor is found append ind_tracker to ind_arr

# PSEUDO BRAINSTORM 2 - Binary search
# initiate a middle argument that will be used to find midpoint
# base case when there is something in ind_arr and next instructor is not target
# change middle based on whether the name is greater or less than target
# append the middle to ind_arr when its equal to target
# after target is found, check to see if name to left is target
# keep going until no longer equal to target

# TODO temporarily made right 26. Figure out how to do later
