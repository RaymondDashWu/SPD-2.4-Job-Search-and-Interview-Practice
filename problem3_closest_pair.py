# Given two arrays a and b of numbers and a target value t, find a number from each array whose sum is closest to t.
# Example: a=[9, 13, 1, 8, 12, 4, 0, 5],  b=[3, 17, 4, 14, 6],  t=20  =>  [13, 6] or [4, 17] or [5, 14]

# PSEUDO BRAINSTORM
# convert smaller array into a set

# initiate closest_tracker to keep track of closest overall 
# and temp_closest for each bigger_array element

# initiate element variable that'll keep track of current element
# loop through bigger array and see if t +/- element until an item is found
# if not found, element += 1
